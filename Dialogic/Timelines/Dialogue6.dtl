Dear Lovis, I trust that if you found this letter then you must’ve escaped the deceptive realm. And I have died. But the truth is, I’ve passed a long time ago. The plague has been slowly reaching out our realm and I had no choice but to stop it. Well at least to try. But thanks to you this threat is no longer there. While you may grieve and resent yourself for falling into this lie. Know that you have done us all a great favor. Please take care of everyone. My dear brother, My Lord. \

Your Truly, \
Lucia
