Lovis: Father, I’m here to rescue my sister and I need help. I know not of the whereabout of they to her cell is and I’m lost.
ChadPriest: Aren’t we all son? Hold tight to the light of the lord and he shall grant you all you need. I must warn you of a physician that you may have met on the way here. That infidel is spreading fake hope that he have found the cure. But I know it’s all lies. After all, medicine is just a tool in the hands of the lord. 
Lovis: Thank you father, I must be on my way now .May the lord of duty and honor guide us. 
ChadPriest: May the lord of duty and honor guide us.
