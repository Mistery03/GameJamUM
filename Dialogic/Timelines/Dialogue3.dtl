Lovis: I’m a paladin and I’m here to rescue my sister. She is imprisoned and I must find the keys to her cell. 
Doctor: Aaaaah the plague is yet calling for another person.  
Lovis: What plague?!! 
Doctor: Have you not seen??! People here are mad. I’ve devoted YEARS of my life to try and find a cure to it, only for this crazy priest to sabotage my plans and hide the cure. Can you even imagine it! A dumb belief killing thousands of people and soon it will be your Sister! 
Lovis: Careful Physician, you may have your own beliefs but like the priest I am a man of god. I shall explore this dungeon further and carry the will of god. If one is desitned to die then so be it.
Doctor: Well then they shall know the blood of innocent people is on their hands. Thank you for passing by my infirmary. I have missed the company of humans. In the case you ever found the cure. Return it to me and know that you will save thousands.
